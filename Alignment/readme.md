# Alignment #

This set of notebooks presents some material for atomic and molecular angular momentum & alignment.
1. [The basic formal machinery: density matrices and state multipoles.](https://github.com/phockett/Quantum-Metrology-with-Photoelectrons/blob/master/Alignment/Alignment-1.ipynb)
2. Application to rotational state-resolved scenarios. (In preparation.)
3. [Application to multi-state cases and wavepackets.](https://github.com/phockett/Quantum-Metrology-with-Photoelectrons/blob/master/Alignment/Alignment-3.ipynb)

For more details and background, see a [Very Brief Introduction to Angular Momentum (lecture notes)](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4003371.v2), and the textbooks from Blum [1] and Zare [2]. The treatment herein is drawn primarily from Blum.

*Note: some maths rendering issues may be apparent with NBviewer and some browsers.*
