abstract = {We performed He I ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) of jet-cooled aromatic molecules using a newly developed photoelectron imaging (PEI) spectrometer. The PEI spectrometer can measure photoelectron spectra and photoelectron angular distributions at a considerably higher efficiency than a conventional spectrometer that uses a hemispherical energy analyzer. One technical problem with PEI is its relatively high susceptibility to background electrons generated by scattered He I radiation. To reduce this problem, we designed a new electrostatic lens that intercepts background photoelectrons emitted from the repeller plate toward the imaging detector. An energy resolution ($\Delta$E/E) of 0.735{\%} at E = 5.461 eV is demonstrated with He I radiation. The energy resolution is limited by the size of the ionization region. Trajectory calculations indicate that the system is capable of achieving an energy resolution of 0.04{\%} with a laser if the imaging resolution is not limited. Experimental results are presented for jet-cooled benzene and pyridine, and they are compared with results in the literature.},
annote = {VMI design for VUV.
Similar to Iain's design.


Thoughts:
- 210meV resolution in basic case matches ours.
- Better resolution only through centroiding???
- Also brief mention of different flight tube lengths, but wouldn't make any difference in the case of phi-dependent imaging.
- Don't show details of SIMION results, so hard to know if their design is identical or somehow different from Iain's in this regard.
- Should check ref. 24 for more details.},
