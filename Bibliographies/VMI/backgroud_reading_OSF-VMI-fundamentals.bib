@article{Suzuki2006,
abstract = {Femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron imaging (TRPEI) is a variant of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy used in the study of gas-phase photoinduced dynamics. A new observable, time-dependent photoionization-differential cross section provides useful information on wave-packet motions, electronic dephasing, and photoionization dynamics. This review describes fundamental issues and the most recent works involving TRPEI.},

abstract = {Ion imaging methods are making ever greater impact on studies of gas phase molecular reaction dynamics. This article traces the evolution of the technique, highlights some of the more important breakthroughs with regards to improving image resolution and in image processing and analysis methods, and then proceeds to illustrate some of the many applications to which the technique is now being applied--most notably in studies of molecular photodissociation and of bimolecular reaction dynamics.},

@article{Vallance2013,
abstract = {The development of sensors capable of detecting particles and radiation with both high time and high positional resolution is key to improving our understanding in many areas of science. Example applications of such sensors range from fundamental scattering studies of chemical reaction mechanisms through to imaging mass spectrometry of surfaces, neutron scattering studies aimed at probing the structure of materials, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements to elucidate the structure and function of biomolecules. In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection - imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity-map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection. In this Perspective, we review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, provide examples of their implementation in a range of different experimental contexts, and discuss potential future developments and applications.},
