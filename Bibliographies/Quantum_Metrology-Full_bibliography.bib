abstract = {We report computer-controlled femtosecond polarization pulse shaping where intensity, momentary frequency, and light polarization are varied as functions of time. For the first time to our knowledge, a pulse shaper is used to modulate the degree of ellipticity as well as the orientation of the elliptical principal axes within a single laser pulse by use of a 256-pixel two-layer liquid-crystal display inside a zero-dispersion compressor. Interferometric stability of the setup is not required. Complete pulse characterization is achieved by dual-channel spectral interferometry. This technology has a large range of applications, especially in the field of quantum control.},

abstract = {Vibrational autoionization induced by the Renner-Teller interaction in linear polyatomic molecules is considered in the context of the three-state electrostatic model developed by Gauyacq and Jungen [Mol. Phys. 41, 383 (1980)]. For small interactions, simple formulas are derived for the quantum defect matrix elements and the autoionization rates in terms of the more common Renner-Teller parameters derived from spectroscopic analyses of low-lying Rydberg states. These formulas should provide guidance for empirical fitting of quantum defect parameters to spectra of high Rydberg states. Consideration of typical values of the Renner-Teller parameters also allows the estimation of vibrational autoionization rates induced by these interactions. These estimates support the validity of the Deltav=-1 propensity rule for vibrational autoionization. Constraints on the vibrational autoionization rates for the symmetric stretching vibration are also discussed. In the following paper, electron capture by polyatomic molecular ions into vibrationally autoionizing Rydberg states is considered from the same perspective, and a simple formula is derived to allow the estimation of the effect of this process on dissociative recombination cross sections.},

abstract = {Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a CD effect up to the ten-percent regime and shows contributions from higher-order Legendre polynomials when multiphoton ionization is compared to single-photon ionization. We give a full account of our experimental methodology for measuring the multiphoton PECD and derive quantitative measures that we apply on camphor, fenchone and norcamphor. Different modulations and amplitudes of the contributing Legendre polynomials are observed despite the similarity in chemical structure. In addition, we study PECD for elliptically polarized light employing tomographic reconstruction methods. Intensity studies reveal dissociative ionization as the origin of the observed PECD effect, whereas ionization of the intermediate resonance is dominating the signal. As a perspective, we suggest to make use of our tomographic data as an experimental basis for a complete photoionization experiment and give a prospect of PECD as an analytic tool.},

abstract = {Vibrationally resolved valence-shell photoionization spectra of H(2), N(2) and CO have been measured in the photon energy range 20-300 eV using third-generation synchrotron radiation. Young's double-slit interferences lead to oscillations in the corresponding vibrational ratios, showing that the molecules behave as two-center electron-wave emitters and that the associated interferences leave their trace in the angle-integrated photoionization cross section. In contrast to previous work, the oscillations are directly observable in the experiment, thereby removing any possible ambiguity related to the introduction of external parameters or fitting functions. A straightforward extension of an original idea proposed by Cohen and Fano [Cohen HD, Fano U (1966) Phys Rev 150:30] confirms this interpretation and shows that it is also valid for diatomic heteronuclear molecules. Results of accurate theoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings.},

A fast time-to-digital converter (TDC) is used to enhance the ion time-of-flight resolution by correlating timestamps registered separately by the Timepix detector and the TDC. In addition, sub-pixel spatial resolution ({\textless}6 $\mu$m) is achieved by the use of a center-of-mass centroiding algorithm. This performance is achieved while retaining a high event rate (104 per s).

@article{Dixit2013,
abstract = {Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray scattering is an emerging approach to image the dynamical evolution of the electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 11636 (2012)]. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of time-resolved x-ray scattering from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and stationary electrons within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several stationary electrons to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering.},
annote = {QI follow-up to the PNAS article.


Not really sure why the semi-classical and QED treatments are fundamentally different - as opposed to by design - since time-dependence seems to be deliberately skipped in the former. Photon momentum transfer is another aspect, guess this is only allowed in QED?

@article{Brixner2001a,
abstract = {Coherent light sources can be used to manipulate the outcome of light-matter interactions by exploiting interference phenomena in the time and frequency domain. A powerful tool in this emerging field of 'quantum control' is the adaptive shaping of femtosecond laser pulses, resulting, for instance, in selective molecular excitation. The basis of this method is that the quantum system under investigation itself guides an automated search, via iteration loops, for coherent light fields best suited for achieving a control task designed by the experimenter. The method is therefore ideal for the control of complex experiments. To date, all demonstrations of this technique on molecular systems have focused on controlling the outcome of photo-induced reactions in identical molecules, and little attention has been paid to selectively controlling mixtures of different molecules. Here we report simultaneous but selective multi-photon excitation of two distinct electronically and structurally complex dye molecules in solution. Despite the failure of single parameter variations (wavelength, intensity, or linear chirp control), adaptive femtosecond pulse shaping can reveal complex laser fields to achieve chemically selective molecular excitation. Furthermore, our results prove that phase coherences of the solute molecule persist for more than 100 fs in the solvent environment.},

The influence of all parameters characterizing the sinusoidal phase modulation on strong-field-induced dynamics is studied systematically in experiment and theory. Our results are interpreted in terms of the selective population of dressed states SPODS which gives a natural physical picture of the dynamics in intense laser fields.We show that modulated femtosecond pulses in combination with photoelectron spectroscopy are a versatile tool to prepare and to probe SPODS.

General concepts of quantum metrology are N-fold resolution enhancement from N-photon entangled states. Seems just like a statistical enhancement but, presumably, requires phase-stability. In particular this scheme uses sequential (time-bin entangled) states, which is very much like a regular pump-probe type configuration.

Don't really understand how this is different to regular auto/cross-correlation (aside from single-photon limit). How is single photon sequential different from statisitcal (repeated) pump-probe?},

In the energy region near the ionization threshold, it has been demonstrated that the MFPAD can be understood by the interference between several partial waves. In the energy region higher than 100eV, the MFPAD has been interpreted by the intra-molecule photoelectron diffraction. That is, it has been verified that multiple-scattering X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) theory is a promising probe of the dynamical process. Therefore, we look into the future: a new methodology for molecular structure determination will be applied to determine ultrafast molecular structure changes due to ultrafast core-level XPD imaging from within, as demonstrated in our simulations for elemental processes of photo-induced unimolecular reactions.},

The method uses a multiconfigurational frozen Gaussian ansatz for the wave function and the key idea is to expand the size of the basis set only during nonadiabatic events, using available information to predict the regions of phase space where population will be created. This is accomplished via the spawning procedure which keeps the basis size manageable while ensuring that it provides a reasonable approximation to the exact wave function. The parameters that govern the numerical accuracy of the method are discussed in detail. Expectation values and branching ratios are predicted quantitatively over a broad range of energies.},

In addition, truly quantum control scenarios are introduced and examined.

abstract = {Imaging the quantum motion of electrons not only in real-time, but also in real-space is essential to understand for example bond breaking and formation in molecules, and charge migration in peptides and biological systems. Time-resolved imaging interrogates the unfolding electronic motion in such systems. We find that scattering patterns, obtained by X-ray time-resolved imaging from an electronic wavepacket, encode spatial and temporal correlations that deviate substantially from the common notion of the instantaneous electronic density as the key quantity being probed. Surprisingly, the patterns provide an unusually visual manifestation of the quantum nature of light. This quantum nature becomes central only for non-stationary electronic states and has profound consequences for time-resolved imaging.},

Several features of formal interest are noted and clarified. Our approach is nonperturbative, treating the laser field within classical and the material system within quantum mechanics. The theory is implemented numerically using a basis set of rotational eigenstates, transforming the time-dependent Schrodinger equation to a set of coupled differential equations where all matrix elements are analytically soluble. The approach was applied over the past few years to explore different adiabatic and nonadiabatic three-dimensional alignment approaches in conjunction with experiments, but its formal details and numerical implementation were not reported in previous studies. Although we provide simple numerical examples to illustrate the content of the equations, our main goal is to complement previous reports through an introductory discussion of the underlying theory.},

The time dependence of the wave packet created by the first pulse can be probed by examination of the total population after the two-pulse sequence. The influence of the relative phase of the two pulses on the total population can be seen as Ramsey fringes. We describe a scheme of wave-packet detection based on this effect.

Coincidence spectroscopy is a powerful approach for carrying out a number of measurements. At its most basic level, coincidence techniques can identify the source of a specific signal, as in the well-known photoelectron-photoion coincidence approach used for several years. By carrying out coincidence experiments in an increasingly differential manner, correlated energy and angular distributions of reaction products may be recorded. Completely energy- and angle-resolved measurements of photoelectrons and ionic or neutral products can reveal molecular-frame photoelectron and photofragment angular distributions and aid in the characterization of dissociative states of molecules and ions. Recent work in this area is reviewed, including examples from studies of dissociative photodetachment, dissociative photoionization, time-resolved studies of dissociative photoionization, and three-body dissociation processes.},

We describe the method and present the application to two molecules of interest in organic photochemistryethylene and cyclobutene. We show that the photodynamics of ethylene involves both covalent and ionic electronic excited states and the return to the ground state proceeds through a pyramidalized geometry. For the photoinduced ring opening of cyclobutene, we show that the disrotatory motion predicted by the Woodward−Hoffmann rules is established within the first 50 fs after optical excitation.},

Consider mostly recording PADs for aligned {\&} anti-aligned ensembles, then comparing to theory.

For alignment, extract {\textless}cos{\^{}}2 2D{\textgreater} from expt.

Orbitals assigned from energy spectra.

Use full CI for electronic wavefunctions (?) in MFPAD calcs.

Expt. and theory compared at the level of LFPAD differences for aligned {\&} anti-aligned ensembles - quite involved and results don't look too bad... although not shown in the clearest fashion. Discussed a bit in terms of photoionization anisotropy.

Pretty vague discussion of partial waves. Not sure if the conclusions are justified there or not, although they're of the 'this suggests this suggests this' type.},

abstract = {One sentence summary: To attain the limits to measurement preci-sion imposed by quantum mechanics, 'quantum tricks' are often required. Abstract: Quantum mechanics, through the Heisen-berg uncertainty principle, imposes limits to the pre-cision of measurement. Conventional measurement techniques typically fail to reach these limits. Con-ventional bounds to the precision of measurements such as the shot noise limit or the standard quan-tum limit are not as fundamental as the Heisenberg limits, and can be beaten using quantum strategies that employ 'quantum tricks' such as squeezing and entanglement.},

The resulting wavepacket dynamics were monitored using a multiphoton ionisation probe. The extensive literature associated with the Clements bands has been summarised and a detailed time domain description of the ultrafast relaxation pathways occurring from the optically bright ([Formula: see text])(1)B1 diabatic state is presented. Signatures of the oscillatory motion on the ([Formula: see text])(1)B1/({\~{A}})(1)A2 lower adiabatic surface responsible for the Clements band structure were observed. The recorded spectra also indicate that a component of the excited state wavepacket undergoes intersystem crossing from the Clements manifold to the underlying triplet states on a sub-picosecond time scale. Photoelectron signal growth time constants have been predominantly associated with intersystem crossing to the ([Formula: see text])(3)B2 state and were measured to vary between 750 and 150 fs over the implemented pump photon energy range. Additionally, pump beam intensity studies were performed. These experiments highlighted parallel relaxation processes that occurred at the one- and two-pump-photon levels of excitation on similar time scales, obscuring the Clements band dynamics when high pump beam intensities were implemented. Hence, the Clements band dynamics may be difficult to disentangle from higher order processes when ultrashort laser pulses and less-differential probe techniques are implemented.},

abstract = {Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) is a powerful tool for the study of intramolecular dynamics, particularly excited state non-adiabatic dynamics in polyatomic molecules. Depending on the problem at hand, different levels of TRPES measurements can be performed: time-resolved photoelectron yield; time- and energy-resolved photoelectron yield; time-, energy-, and angle-resolved photoelectron yield. In this pedagogical overview, a conceptual framework for time-resolved photoionization measurements is presented, together with discussion of relevant theory for the different aspects of TRPES. Simple models are used to illustrate the theory, and key concepts are further amplified by experimental examples. These examples are chosen to show the application of TRPES to the investigation of a range of problems in the excited state dynamics of molecules: from the simplest vibrational wavepacket on a single potential energy surface; to disentangling intrinsically coupled electronic and nuclear motions; to identifying the electronic character of the intermediate states involved in non-adiabatic dynamics by angle-resolved measurements in the molecular frame, the most complete measurement.},

Generation is accomplished by means of multiphoton ionization of an atomic prototype using polarization-shaped femtosecond laser pulses. Both the electronic structure of the neutral and interference of matter wave packets in the continuum contribute to the final shape. For the measurement of the resulting three-dimensional photoelectron angular distributions (3dPAD) we combine the established technique of velocity map imaging (VMI) with a tomographic reconstruction method. This novel experimental approach can be employed to characterize the 3dPAD in the laboratory frame as well as in the molecular frame of larger molecules. Due to its sensitivity to electronic structure this method can be further developed to highly sensitive analytic techniques in the gas phase, for instance for the identification of chiral molecules.},

Calculations predict that two-color nonlinear WPI data can be used to reconstruct a rovibronic target wave packet evolving under an incompletely characterized nuclear Hamiltonian. This can be accomplished by the isolation via phase cycling or wave-vector matching of an exhaustive collection of overlaps between the unknown target and the members of a family of reference wave packets whose form is known by construction. This review highlights recent experiments employing WPI to gain amplitude-level information about the photoexcited-state dynamics of small molecules in the gas phase and in rare-gas crystals. I briefly describe a new semiclassical theory for condensed-phase WPI and other coherence-spectroscopy measurements, such as time-resolved coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, and mention our initial studies of nonlinear WPI from electronic energy-transfer complexes.},

 controlled on an attosecond time scale by varying the time delay between the two pulses. In
 addition, we show that such asymmetric emission is also related to the properties of the attosecond

abstract = {A high-resolution recoil-ion momentum spectrometer based on a precooled localized supersonic jet target (COLTRIMS) has been combined with a novel low-energy electron analyzer with 4$\pi$ solid angle for electrons with energies Ee ≤ 30 eV including Ee = 0 eV. Thus, three recoil-ion momentum components, the recoil-ion charge state and three momentum components of one electron emitted in any collision-induced ionization reaction are measured simultaneously with a coincidence efficiency of 28{\%}. In order to accept large recoil-ion longitudinal momenta (along the beam) of pR‖ ≤ 160 a.u. and simultaneously guarantee a superior resolution in this direction ($\Delta$ PR‖ ≤ ± 0.08 a.u.), recoil ions are extracted in the longitudinal direction different from all former concepts. Test measurements, details on the present design and results of a kinematically complete experiment for single ionization are presented and possible further improvements are discussed. The future potential of such spectrometers for the investigation of collision-induced atomic many-particle reactions, the “Coulomb-explosion” of molecules and the spectroscopy of electronic states in heavy few-electron systems is illustrated. Similar techniques might be used to measure angular correlations and even the neutrino mass in $\beta$-decay experiments.},

Example applications of such sensors range from fundamental scattering studies of chemical reaction mechanisms through to imaging mass spectrometry of surfaces, neutron scattering studies aimed at probing the structure of materials, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements to elucidate the structure and function of biomolecules. In addition to improved throughput resulting from parallelisation of data collection - imaging of multiple different fragments in velocity-map imaging studies, for example - fast image sensors also offer a number of fundamentally new capabilities in areas such as coincidence detection. In this Perspective, we review recent developments in fast image sensor technology, provide examples of their implementation in a range of different experimental contexts, and discuss potential future developments and applications.},

@article{Akoury2007,
abstract = {The wave nature of particles is rarely observed, in part because of their very short de Broglie wavelengths in most situations. However, even with wavelengths close to the size of their surroundings, the particles couple to their environment (for example, by gravity, Coulomb interaction, or thermal radiation). These couplings shift the wave phases, often in an uncontrolled way, and the resulting decoherence, or loss of phase integrity, is thought to be a main cause of the transition from quantum to classical behavior. How much interaction is needed to induce this transition? Here we show that a photoelectron and two protons form a minimum particle/slit system and that a single additional electron constitutes a minimum environment. Interference fringes observed in the angular distribution of a single electron are lost through its Coulomb interaction with a second electron, though the correlated momenta of the entangled electron pair continue to exhibit quantum interference.},

@article{Wohlleben2005,
abstract = {Motivated originally by the goal of steering a photoreaction into desired product channels, the concept of coherent control is to adapt the spectral and temporal characteristics of the excitation light to the inherent molecular resonances and dynamics, such that these can be selectively addressed and manipulated. In the last decade, the ultrafast dynamics of many atomic and molecular quantum systems in the gas and condensed phase have been controlled successfully. Motivations in chemistry are now 1) to perform spectroscopy by coherent control, which requires a deeper understanding of control mechanisms, 2) to treat more complex, biological photoreactions, and 3) the pragmatic use of coherent control techniques, for example, for pulse compression or enhanced contrast in multiphoton microscopy. As examples for 1) and 2) we review here the combined effort and interplay of conventional spectroscopy and coherent control experiments, applied to the energy flow in the light-harvesting complex LH2 from bacterial photosynthesis. Closed-loop control experiments allowed the characteristic coupling frequency of internal conversion in the carotenoid in LH2 to be extracted. Open-loop three-pulse control experiments, on the other hand, could directly observe an anticipated Raman-excited carotenoid ground state. As a variant of difference spectroscopy, coherent control has thus served to gain complementary spectroscopic knowledge about the energy flow in carotenoids by comparing natural to manipulated dynamics. Finally, we propose future coherent control experiments on the electronic state structure of carotenoids and discuss prospects of coherent control for other biological chromophores.},

This method, slow electron velocity-map imaging, provides spectral line widths of better than 1 meV. Spectra over a substantial range of electron kinetic energies are recorded in a single image, providing a dramatic reduction of data acquisition time compared to other techniques with comparable resolution. We apply this technique to atomic iodine and the van der Waals cluster I.CO2 as test systems, and then to the prereactive Cl.D2 complex where partially resolved structure assigned to hindered rotor motion is observed.},

abstract = {In classical estimation theory, the central limit theorem implies that the statistical error in a measurement outcome can be reduced by an amount proportional to n{\^{}}(-1/2) by repeating the measures n times and then averaging. Using quantum effects, such as entanglement, it is often possible to do better, decreasing the error by an amount proportional to 1/n. Quantum metrology is the study of those quantum techniques that allow one to gain advantages over purely classical approaches. In this review, we analyze some of the most promising recent developments in this research field. Specifically, we deal with the developments of the theory and point out some of the new experiments. Then we look at one of the main new trends of the field, the analysis of how the theory must take into account the presence of noise and experimental imperfections.},

The potential inversion is performed by a new formula which expresses an excited state potential in terms of the ground state potential, the transition frequencies, and the transition-dipole matrix elements, whose sign is shown to be derivable from the spectral line strengths.

abstract = {We analyze and further develop our method of quantum-state holography for reconstructing quantum su- perposition states in molecules or atoms ?Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1418 ?1998??. The technique is based on mixing the unknown object state with a known reference state generated in the same system by two delayed laser pulses, and detecting the total time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence as a function of the delay. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by reconstructing various vibrational wave packets in sodium dimers. Both the cases of completely controlled and noisy relative phase between the laser pulses are considered. In the latter case, we use the technique of coherence observation by interference noise to recover the interference component of the fluorescence signal. Our results clearly demonstrate the robustness of quantum-state holog- raphy and the high quality of reconstruction even in the presence of the external noise. ?S1050-2947?99?06403-3?},

@article{Townsend2006a,
abstract = {The authors report time resolved photoelectron spectra of the B21($\Sigma$u+1) state of CS2 at pump wavelengths in the region of 200nm. In contrast to previous studies, the authors find that the predissociation dynamics is not well described by a single exponential decay. Biexponential modeling of the authors' data reveals a rapid decay pathway ($\tau${\textless}50fs), in addition to a longer lived channel ($\tau$∼350–650fs) that displays a marked change in apparent lifetime when the polarization of the pump laser is rotated with respect to that of the probe. Since the initially populated B21($\Sigma$u+1) state may decay to form either S(D1) or S(P3) products (the latter produced via a spin-orbit induced crossing from a singlet to a triplet electronic surface), this lifetime observation may be rationalized in terms of changes in the relative ionization cross section of these singlet and triplet states of CS2 as a function of laser polarization geometry. The experimentally observed lifetime of the longer lived channel is therefore a superp...},
